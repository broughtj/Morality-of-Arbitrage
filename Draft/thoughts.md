# Thoughts on Planning Out the Paper

1. Start with Coase's paper and layout his topic: the differential treatment of the markets for goods and ideas. He sees
   this as incongruent.
2. Next move to Hayek and his treatment of the economic problem that society faces as one of the utilization of
   knowledge. For Hayek markets are information systems, and their essential characteristic is that they solve and
   informational problem. This strengthens Coase's belief that the differential treatment of the market for goods and
   the market for ideas is incoherent. All markets are about knowledge. There is no reason to treat the market for ideas
   as somehow special. The economic process is an information process. Knowledge regarding the relative prices of
   commodities is not essentially different in its economic properties as that of scholarly or scientific knowledge.
	* Minor themes: in order to be rational we need other people's brains
	* Scientific knowledge is elevated in our society, but knowledge of all sorts is essential! Otherwise we would
	  starve. 
	* Those who see themselves as possessing special knowledge (scholarly, scientific, etc) regard with contempt those
	  who gain advantage over them since they see themselves as possessing superior knowledge. Good old fashioned
	  jealousy.  
	* We should be in awe of the price mechanism. If we had invented it, we would consider it the greatest invention of
	  humankind! 
	* The man on the spot provides an eminently useful role in society!
3. From Coase and Hayek we move to de Finetti and Nau. We examine de Finetti's theory of subjective probability and
   economic coherence. Dutch books, or the principle of no-arbitrage. Nau expands on de Finetti to found the Arbitrage
   Choice Theory (ACT). No-arbitrage is the fundamental principle of economic rationality. Rationality is a market-level
   emergent phenomenon. 
4. Explain the Dutch Book Theorem.
5. Give examples in the academic literature of the scholarly arguments that can be framed as Dutch Book arguments. 
	- Culp & Miller vs Pirrong
	- Swinburne vs Howson
6. Frame Coase's argument as a Dutch Book argument. 
7. Summary and conclusion.
