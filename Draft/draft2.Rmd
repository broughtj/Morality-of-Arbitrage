title: "The Morality of Arbitrage"
author:
- name: Tyler J. Brough
  affiliation: Utah State University
abstract: "In this paper, I argue that one cannot rationally believe that financial arbitrage is an inherently immoral pursuit, while simultaneously believing that the pursuit of academic knowledge is an inherently moral pursuit. I argue that these two seemingly separate activities are really one and the same. Further those that do hold such contradictory beliefs are behaving incoherently and have a Dutch book made against them."

# Introduction

In this essay I follow the lead of @Coase1974, and examine the very common differential treatment of the market for goods and the market for ideas. 

The plan of this paper is as follows: section 2 introduces Coases's original argument, and his conclusion that
their different treatment is incongruous; section 3 discusses the view in @Hayek1945 that the essential
nature of the economic problem is one of the utilization of knowledge. For Hayek, the economic process is an
information process and markets can be seen, using the modern parlance, as information systems. There is thus
no justification for the differential treatment of goods and ideas; section 4 introduces the concept of
subjective probability following @deFinetti1937, as well as the Arbitrage Choice Theory outlined in @Nau1999;
section 5 explains, as essential background, the Dutch Book Theorem; section 6 gives a few chosen examples of
scholarly debates framed as Dutch Book arguments; section 6 frames Coases's original argument as a Dutch Book
argument; section 7 concludes.
